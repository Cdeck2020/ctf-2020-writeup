There's a new game in the city called Amoonguss and seems like you could hack it pretty easily, demonstrate the vulnerability by successfully winning 30 rounds of the game. The game maker has also put a few flags in there to reward you as you try to pentest the web app.
Note: You may not use automated bruteforce tools for this challenge.

What is flag 1? (Inspect Element)

What is flag 2? (Network Tab in Inspect Element thing --> Response Header)

What is flag 3? (Get to end of game by Searching for "sus" in the source code)
